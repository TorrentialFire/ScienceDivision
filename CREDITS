// Crybow
ZZrionTheInsect - Base Sprite/Design/Idea, Final Crossbow head Design/Animation, cool "string" frames, being a pretty cool guy.
		Implementation tweaks that I may not know of, came up with a way to shatter frozen corpses with a freezing weapon.

Bloax - Shading tweaks, firing animation/design (this took some serious thinking), Additional firing animation tweak(, apparently made this thing go out of control)
		Impact animation, Small implementation modifications. (Why is my list this big?)
		
Xaser - Implementation, Palette modifications (see: CryoPal.wad), Smoke (And probably more but Bloax is ignorant yes.)
		Sound effects.
		
Ethril - Coming up with the insane idea that is called a "railgun crossbow", he should be put into a mental institution or somethin-
		 OH WAIT NO THAT'S COMPLETELY AWESOME YES
